# Parking Management System

This project aims to **automatically detect vehicle entry and exit** and **fully digitize parking management**. Vehicle and license plate recognition (YOLO + EasyOCR) is performed through camera footage, while users can manage reservations, payments, and balance operations through a Django-based web interface.

## Features

### 🚗 Vehicle Detection and License Plate Recognition
- Vehicle detection using YOLO
- License plate reading with EasyOCR
- Valid license plates stored in SQLite database

### 📅 Reservation and Payment Management
- Create, edit, and delete reservations through web interface
- Parking fee calculation (time-based)
- User balance and payment processing

### 💾 Database Integration (SQLite)
- Entry/exit information and billing records are stored
- User, reservation, and payment information centralized in one place

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd parking-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run Django migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the local server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) in your browser
2. Register or log in to your account
3. Manage your parking reservations
4. Track payment status with your license plate information

## Testing and Validation

- Test the project using **Pytest** or Django test commands:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

- Critical functionality including vehicle and license plate recognition, reservations, and payments are verified for proper operation

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
